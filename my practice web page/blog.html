        <p>hi guys,<br>
            my name is skiller and this is my first blog.
            its been a few days since i started learning coding seriously on my own using free resoursess like youtube,codecamp ,etc they helped me a lot but i did'nt understand all the things taught there so after doing some research online and i came to know about khan academy. i have been learning from it for a 3-4 days and now i can say for sure i understand all the things taught there(no this not sponsered, im not being payed to say all this. i would like it if i was but im not :/ )<br><br>
         I got the idea of making a blog by KA(khan academy) to document my journey. i had already thought of a way to document my journey, i was going to make a website where i would write/implement everything i have learn everyday. im thinking of still doing it and having the link of the website on my profile when i learn how to uplaod it online and make it visibile to public.<br>
        </p>
        <p>ok enough with the intro, now on to what i learned today</p><br>
       <u> <p id="font-style"> 1.FONT-STYLE</u><br> now i know how to style the text on my website using css for eg.</p><p class="italic"> I made this para italic without warping it in the "em" tag,
             instead i made use of the css property "font-style"<br>the "font-style" tag consists of 3 diffrent value</p> 
            <ol>
                <li>normal</li>
                <li class="italic">italic</li>
                <li  class="oblique">oblique</li>
            </ol>
            <u><p id="font-weight">2.FONT-WEIGHT </p></u>
            <P> just like the "font-style" "font-weight" also styles the text when css is used on it</P>
            <p class="bold">the only difference between "font-style" and "font-weight" is that "font-weight" changes the the thickness of the letters<br>the "font-weight" tag consists of 3 values</p>
              <ol>  
              <li>normal</li>
                <li class="bold">bold</li>
                <li class="w">900</li>
            </ol>
        <u><p id="font-family">3.FONT-FAMILY</p></u>
        <p>"font-family" tag can be used to choose what type of font text u would like your users to see.There are 1000s of font family u can choose from but<br> These 3 are present on almost every pc by default </p>
        <ol>
            <li class="serif">serif</li>
            <li class="sans-serif">sans-serif</li>
            <li class="monospace">monospace</li>
        </ol>
        <p id="line-height"><u>4.LINE-HEIGHT</u></p>
        <P>"line-height" tag can be used to adjust the space between line of text<br>
        there are many values that are used in this tag for eg.
        </P>
        <ol>
            <li>normal</li>
            <li>precentage example for CSS</li>
            <li>lenght(em,px,rem)</li>
             <li>number</li>
        </ol>
